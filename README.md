**Note:**
This a fork of the original project as it's no longer maintained.

## Usage
- Make sure Python3 is installed properly, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then you can use `1fichier-dl.vbs` to launch the program

## To do
- Figure out a way to build this into a executable for release, haven't been succesful at it... for now use the VBS script

## Fork Features
- Fix looping bug when proxy works but download fails
- Allows to input custom proxy list via a URL in the Settings > Connection menu (example list: https://pastebin.com/raw/uVVLrxyd), should use HTTPS proxies, if you don't input anything then it defaults to getting proxies from proxyscan.io
